# PowerBI-project-on-Sales
This Power BI project delivers a complete analysis of global sales of a firm from 2020 to 2024, covering regions such as Europe, Australia, and North America. The main dashboard visualizes total sales versus targets, profit margins, and product-category performance across clothing, bikes, accessories, and cleaning equipment. Users can interactively explore trends by continent, country, and product line to uncover key sales drivers and underperforming areas. An additional drill-down report complements this by breaking down sales performance by Order Year. The table highlights steady growth from $6.54M in 2020 to $9.74M in 2022, with total margins peaking at 83.33% in 2021 and order volumes more than tripling over the same period. This report reinforces insights from the visual dashboard, showing how Adventure Works scaled up operations rapidly while maintaining strong profitability. Developed with Power BI, DAX, Power Query (M), and star-schema data modeling, this project showcases data transformation, KPI development,Return on Investment (ROI) and interactive storytelling through advanced visualization and drill-down techniques.
